Hi,

I have developed the java code using Eclipse IDE and executed it in the same. I set the prefrences for all in the IDE.
For windows I have to start rmiregistry in source folder where all java files are located. 

The program for JNI is coded in Visual C compiler which has minor differences from gcc on linux.
The library file for the JNI for Java is located in the following path AgentC\bin\Debug of the zip folder.
